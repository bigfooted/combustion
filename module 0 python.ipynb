    "When you have loaded this notebook in JupyterLabs, you will see that the notebook consists of input cells and output cells. You can select cell by clicing on them or by moving to cells with the arrow buttons. The selected cell is highlighted on the left by a blue vertical bar. You can edit a cell by double-clicking on it. The input cells can be one of two types: a *Code* cell or a *Markdown* cell. Markdown simply means special text: You can change the font, the color, the size and even add html or Latex code, for instance an equation can be written like this:\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\cdot x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and html like this:\n",
    "<span style='color:Blue'> Blue color.  </span>\n",

    "For a more complete overview of markdown options, you can check out [this website:](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)\n",

    "Note that when you click on the input cell, you can edit it. You can evaluate the cell by pressing the *play* button above or by pressing SHIFT+ENTER while inside an input cell. Please test it on this input cell."

    "2. Create a 2d numpy array with 20 equally spaced time intervals Δt from t=0 until the projectile hits the ground again ($t=t_{\\textrm{end}}$). Your timestep should depend on your choice for the initial velocity components. **[2 pts]**\n",
